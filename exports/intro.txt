In 2011, after years of conflict surrounding the nation's oil wealth, South Sudan gained independence from Sudan.  Following the referendum for independence,
it was thought that all violence and conflict in the nation would cease, however, not long after the vote, South Sudan found itself in the midst of a brutal
civil war.  A currupt president, widespread drought and subsequent famine, economic woes, and continuous violence has turned South Sudan into a humanitarian disaster.
Many organizations are working to try and improve the situation in South Sudan, including the World Food Programme, UNCHR, USAID, and so on.  This site is designed
to be an overview of the many factors that are contributing to this humanitarian crisis.  Scroll through the site to see the South Sudan situational overview and
